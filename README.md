# Image processing with Machine Learning and TensorFlow
This repository contains my attempt at image processing, classification, and prediction with Machine Learning and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org), Google's open-source library for machine intelligence. As a beginner in Machine Learning, I am pushing all commits to this repository so that you also can learn it on your own with limitations provided under the MIT license. 

The contents of this repository are of completion of the [CADL tutorial](https://github.com/pkmital/CADL) by [Parag K Mital](https://github.com/pkmital). Free online lesson can be found at [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info).
