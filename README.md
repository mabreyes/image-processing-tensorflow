# Selfpaced Machine Learning and TensorFlow codes
This repository is a collection of my machine learning and TensorFlow. It contains Python scripts, Markdowns, and Jupyter Notebooks. I'm a total beginner of Machine Learning so I'm pushing all my commits in this repository to every milestone and codes I've done during my selfpaced tutorials.

The contents of this repository are of completion of the tutorial by [@pkmital/CADL](https://github.com/pkmital/CADL). Free online lesson can be found at [Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info).
