# Selfpaced Machine Learning and TensorFlow codes
This repository is a collection of my machine learning and TensorFlow. It contains Python scripts, Markdowns, and Jupyter Notebooks. I'm a total beginner of Machine Learning so I'm pushing all my commits in this repository to every milestone and codes I've done during my selfpaced tutorials.
